JukeBukkit allows users to craft blank discs, called Obsidyiscs. You can burn these discs with music of your liking, music that is hosted on the internet somewhere, and play the music on your obsidyiscs in jukeboxes, also crafted by players.

* This does not require users to use spoutcraft to be able to log in to the server. However, players without spoutcraft will be unable to see jukeboxes or hear them, and will only see Flint.
* Install by placing jukebukkit.jar into your bukkit server's plugin folder.
* Restart Server

*Important If you plan to use the Web Server*

* After restarted, you *must* edit the config.yml for JukeBukkit.
* Set the minecraftServerHostname config option to your server's Domain name, or IP Address, that your user's use to connect to your server.
* Make sure to set the webServerPort to an open port on your server, and the appropriate port forwarding has been established so that users can connect to the webServer.
* Restart Server
